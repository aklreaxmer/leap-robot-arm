<h1> Leap Robot Arm </h1>

First upload the Arduino sketch, then run the python script. This code is meant for a robot arm with 3 servos: two controlling the X and Y motion of the arm, and one controlling the opening/closing of a claw.

The arm moves based on the X and Y position of your palm. A closed hand will close the claw, and an open hand will open it.
